                                                        <p>Second half of the 18th century, the designers took inspiration from Classical art. This interest was inspired by the archaeological finds in sites situated in places such as Greece, Italy and Egypt. John Baskerville, an english designer of that period, defined the shapes of neoclassical typography: the fonts had sharper serifs and more contrast between thick-and-thin strokes than Rococo typefaces, and his letters had a more vertical, geometric axis.</p>

                                                        <img src="assets/images/image2.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%">

                                                        <p>In Italy, in late 18th century/early 19th century, Giambattista Bodoni, a printer that worked at the Royal Press of Parma, published the Manuale Tipografico (1788), in which he declared his design statements and ideals on Neoclassicism. Bodoni drew inspiration from Baskerville as he evolved his preferences from Rococo-derived designs toward modern typefaces. He achieved a purity of form with sparse pages, generous margins and line-spacing, and severe geometric types; this functional purity avoided any distractions from the act of reading. </p>

                                                        <p>Also the books designed by the Didot family of printers in France, shared the same purity: minimal decoration, generous margins, and simple linear borders. </p>

                                                        <p>Thus, the font-family used are, in fact Bodoni and Baskerville, the shapes are regular, straight, the margins and the padding are generous and the serifs are sharp. The background color, a gentle light green, reminds the color of the wallpaper used in Regency and Neoclassical villas and palaces. </p>

                                                            in newspapers in that era, I've added a sepia filter to
                                                            them. The filter makes them

                                                        <p>Every movement in the first half of the 20th century has
                                                            created the characteristic
                                                            typography of this period. For example in Germany Peter
                                                            Behrens played major role in
                                                            design and typography. Behrens’s work for AEG was a
                                                            forerunner of a major area of graphic
                                                            design in the second half of the 20th century. He led the
                                                            creation of a corporate identity
                                                            through a program using trademarks, typefaces, formats, and
                                                            color in a consistent,
                                                            controlled manner.</p>

                                                        <p> We see that Cassandre uses modulated color planes derived
                                                            from figurative geometry and
                                                            Cubism in his poster designs. Cassandre has also used
                                                            airbrushed mixes to soften hard
                                                            geometry. The hardness of the lines softens with the color
                                                            palette used.</p>

                                                            gave me plenty of space to
                                                            experiment with the layout and the fonts.The use of the grid
                                                            system, however, is almost
                                                            compulsory, as it is a common practice in modern and
                                                            postmodern graphic design. After
                                                            creating the grid, I've placed the content in a
                                                            <q>chaotic</q>way since it is a
                                                            characteristic of this style. I've set the right and top
                                                            borders black to create an
                                                            unusual, assymetric effect.
                                                            I've used a variety of fonts, including a textured
                                                            experimental font for headings and
                                                            code/typewriter-like fonts to emphasize information. The
                                                            articles are split into columns
                                                            and decorated with an extra bold red margin on the bottom.
                                                            I've created a plumbob shape in
                                                            Photoshop which is similar to the
                                                            often hand-drawn illustrations found in these magazines.
                                                            This style is characterised by
                                                            the occassional use of color apart from black, grey, and
                                                            white, therefore I've only used
                                                            red to pop out from the context.</p>

                                            create coherence
                                            between our work and to make the CSS markup unified.
                                            The elements we used are the main elements that appear in all of the
                                            articles: headings,
                                            paragraphs, quotes, links, tables, images. We have divided the articles into
                                            four main classes:
                                            header containing the title and additional information, subhead containing
                                            the subtitle and
                                            additional information, content containing the article itself and footer
                                            containing additional
                                            information. </p>
